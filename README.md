# 📊 Student Performance Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a student performance dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between academic performance and behavioral factors such as study hours and attendance.

The goal of this analysis is to demonstrate data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and insight generation using Python.

This project was completed as part of the **CodeAlpha Data Analytics Virtual Internship**.
