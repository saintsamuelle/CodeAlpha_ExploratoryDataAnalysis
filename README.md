# Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📊 Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data analytics workflow. This project aims to explore, understand, and analyze a dataset to uncover hidden patterns, trends, relationships, and potential data quality issues before applying advanced analytics or machine learning models.

This project was completed as part of the **CodeAlpha Data Analytics Virtual Internship**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
The main goals of this project are to:
- Understand the structure and nature of the dataset
- Ask meaningful analytical questions before analysis
- Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies
- Validate assumptions using statistics and visualizations
- Detect missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies
- Prepare insights to guide further analysis or modeling

---

## ❓ Key Questions Asked Before Analysis
- What variables are present in the dataset?
- What data types do the variables have?
- Are there missing or inconsistent values?
- How are numerical variables distributed?
- Are there relationships or correlations between variables?
- Are there outliers or unusual patterns in the data?

## 🔍 Steps Performed in EDA
1. **Data Loading**
   - Imported the dataset using Pandas

2. **Data Inspection**
   - Viewed dataset shape, columns, and sample records
   - Checked data types and summary statistics

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Identified and handled missing values
   - Detected duplicates and inconsistencies

4. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Distribution analysis using histograms and box plots
   - Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)

5. **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**
   - Correlation analysis
   - Scatter plots and heatmaps
   - Relationship exploration between variables

6. **Outlier Detection**
   - Box plots and statistical techniques

7. **Insights & Findings**
   - Key trends, anomalies, and patterns documented

---
